# Project Idea - Overview:

**talkitover connects you with random strangers around the world who are willing to talk to you about your problems, as well as sharing their own.**   
**As a community, we've found that talking through our emotional, psychological, or mental issues is one of the best methods of releasing our anger, stress, depression or pain.**  
**Sharing and connecting with other strangers who are going through a struggle just like you provides great consolation to anyone in need of healing or a friend.**

# User Stories

1. As a guest, I want to be able to sign-in/sign-up directly to the web app or by a third-party integration.

2. As a user, I want to be able to view the home page where I can see daily quotes and articles and save favorite quotes and articles to my profile so that I can check them whenever I want.

3. As a user, I want to be able to view my own profile so that I can edit my information and see my saved items or remove them, and see my reviews.

4. As a user, I want to be able to view other users' profiles but not edit them, but can only add a review.

5. As a user, I want to be able to view the posts page where I can share a post about my problem or ask a question and seek help and advice from others.

6. As a post owner, I want to be able to add (and update) my availability time, so that other users know when they can join a chat room with me.

7. As a user, I want to be able to book a post owner if the availability time suits me, so that we can join a private chat room at that time.

8. As an admin, I want to be the only one who's able to delete other users accounts based on bad reviews or bad posts/comments so that we can ensure the safety of other users.
